# DEVPLAN — DevX Control Plane (DCP)

**AUTHORITY LEVEL: AL:1**
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Updated:** 2026-06-06

---

## CANONICAL DOC RULE

`DEVPLAN.md` owns: current execution state, active milestones, release targets, SKU roadmap.
`DEVPATH.md` owns: phase history, design decisions, origin story, task registry.

---

## CURRENT POSITION

**Active phase:** Phase 5 — Growth
**Current version:** v1.0.0 (Studio — all modules complete)
**Next release target:** v1.1.0 — Cross-platform (Mac/Linux PS7 support)

v1.0.0 is complete. All modules shipped: Core, Governance Kit, Agent Kit, Team Kit, Distribution CLI, Consulting. GitHub template repo is live. Next phase focuses on widening the audience (portability), deepening eco integration, and building toward a product with a real moat (VS Code extension → SaaS → Agent Infrastructure).

## SKU ROADMAP

DCP is designed as a modular product. Each SKU is independently releaseable.

### DCP Core (free / open source)
**Target:** v0.2.0

The minimum viable DCP. Portable and replicable by any developer.

Includes:
- `projects.yaml` schema and conventions
- `dev-status.ps1` dashboard
- `validate-pointers.ps1` pointer checker
- `protect-sources.ps1` corpus guard
- `DEV-CONTROL-PLANE.md` boundary doctrine
- `README.md`
- `ONBOARDING.md`
- `docs/SKU-BOUNDARIES.md`

**Audience:** Any developer managing 3+ repos who wants a registry-driven portfolio view.

---

### DCP Governance Kit (paid or premium tier)
**Target:** v0.3.0

The planning and normalization layer. Separable from Core.

Includes:
- `docs/templates/` — DEV-PLAN, DEV-PATH, TRACKS, PROJECT-STATUS templates
- `docs/planning-normalization.md` — vocabulary, pointer shape, canonical patterns
- DEVPLAN + DEVPATH conventions
- Planning health tooling (already in dashboard)

**Audience:** Teams with multiple active projects who need consistent planning across repos.

---

### DCP Agent Kit (paid — primary differentiator)
**Target:** v0.4.0

The AI-agent governance layer. This is what separates DCP from generic service catalogs.

Includes:
- Generalised task template set (task-level governance with authority levels)
- Model routing pattern library (which agent/model for which task type)
- Agent onboarding doc template
- Multi-window / multi-agent handoff protocol
- Agent-readable planning doc conventions

**Audience:** Developers running multi-agent workflows who need routing, audit trails, and governance.

---

### DCP Studio (bundled)
**Target:** v1.0.0

All modules. Intended for solo developers or small teams running AI-augmented multi-repo development at scale.

Includes: Core + Governance Kit + Agent Kit + onboarding doc + setup guide.

---

### DCP Consulting (service)
**Target:** v1.0.0

Custom setup, workflow design, and training. Delivered as an engagement.

Deliverables: configured DCP instance, custom `projects.yaml` schema, agent routing table, team onboarding session.

**Audience:** Teams adopting AI-augmented development who want a proven starting point rather than building from scratch.

## MARKET POSITION

**Problem:** AI-agent-assisted development is chaotic at scale. No standard tooling exists for governing multi-agent workflows across multi-repo portfolios.

**Solution:** DCP — a typed, registry-driven control plane with first-class agent governance. Borrows from enterprise service catalog patterns (Backstage) and applies them at individual and studio scale.

**Differentiation:**
- Agent Kit is the only module in this space addressing agent routing, authority levels, and audit trails at task granularity
- Boundary doctrine prevents the common failure mode of conflating governance, standards, execution, and runtime
- Modular — you can adopt any single layer without buying into the full stack

**Adjacent tools:** Backstage (enterprise only, no agent layer), Linear (project execution only), Notion (no integrity enforcement), GitHub Projects (no cross-repo registry, no agent support).

**Target customers:**
1. Solo developers running 3+ repos with AI agents
2. Small teams (2–8 people) adopting AI-augmented development
3. Studios and consultancies building AI-assisted products
