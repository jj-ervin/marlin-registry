# DEV-PATH — Marlin Registry

**AUTHORITY LEVEL: AL:1**
**Status:** ACTIVE — single authoritative source for DCP development path
**Updated:** 2026-06-06
**Supersedes:** N/A — first canonical planning doc for DCP

---

## CANONICAL DOC RULE

`DEV-PATH.md` owns: phase history, design decisions, origin story, and task registry.
`DEV-PLAN.md` owns: current execution state, active milestones, release targets, SKU roadmap.

This file governs the portable DCP template repo as a product.

---

## AGENT ONBOARDING

Before working on DCP as a product, read in order:

1. `DEV-CONTROL-PLANE.md` — boundary doctrine, the core architectural decision
2. `docs/planning-normalization.md` — planning standard (DCP enforces this for others)
3. **This file** — phase history, design rationale
4. `DEV-PLAN.md` — current release targets and work queue
5. `README.md` — user-facing product description

DCP Core components are in this repository. When installed, they may live in a dedicated `devx-control-plane/` folder or directly in a user's portfolio root.

---

## ORIGIN

DCP emerged from a governance session on 2026-06-05/06 during which a local multi-repo portfolio was audited and the following were established in a single working session:

- Boundary doctrine (`DEV-CONTROL-PLANE.md`) — what lives in each layer and why
- Planning normalization standard (`docs/planning-normalization.md`)
- Pre-commit source protection (`protect-sources.ps1`)
- Planning pointer validator (`validate-pointers.ps1`)
- Portfolio dashboard enhancement (`dev-status.ps1` — status + plan health columns)
- Planning template kit (`docs/templates/`)
- Portfolio registry cleanup (`projects.yaml` — 27 pointers verified)

The architectural position (standards / control plane / project repos / runtime) is the stable foundation DCP is built on.

## PHASE HISTORY

### Phase 0 — Foundation (2026-06-05 → 2026-06-06) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Establish the original local workspace as a governed portfolio control plane.

**Key decisions:**
- The portfolio root is a *control plane*, not a monorepo. This distinction prevents it from absorbing execution artifacts.
- Portability rule: reusable standards belong outside the local DCP instance; local workflow and registry conventions belong in DCP.
- Runtime state (live task queues, agent handoffs) must not be committed — it belongs in a workspace or database.
- `project-orchestrator-agent` holds the runtime *contract and schemas*, not live state.

**Completed:**
- DCP.00 — Boundary doctrine written and committed
- DCP.01 — Source corpus protection (pre-commit hook)
- DCP.02 — Planning pointer validator
- DCP.03 — Dashboard status + plan health columns
- DCP.04 — Planning template kit (4 templates)
- DCP.05 — projects.yaml pointer audit and normalization (27 verified)
- DCP.06 — README, --help, DEV-PLAN, DEV-PATH (this file)

---

### Phase 1 — Extraction & Packaging (2026-06-06) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Make DCP portable — extractable from the original reference workspace and replicable by others.

**Key decisions:**
- DCP Core is the standalone template repo: registry, dashboard, pointer validator, source guard, boundary doctrine, README, onboarding, and SKU boundaries.
- Governance Kit is the separable planning layer: templates, planning normalization, and planning audit conventions.
- Agent Kit is the separable multi-agent workflow layer: task templates, routing patterns, onboarding, handoff protocol, and audit conventions.
- Runtime state remains outside the repo.

**Completed:**
- DCP.10 — Extracted DCP into a standalone template/scaffold repo
- DCP.11 — Defined SKU boundaries in `docs/SKU-BOUNDARIES.md`
- DCP.12 — Wrote DCP onboarding doc for new users
- DCP.13 — Wrote consulting pitch one-pager

---

### Phase 2 — Governance Kit Module (current)

**Goal:** Package the planning and normalization layer as a separable module.

Planned:
- audit `docs/templates/` for generic language
- promote `docs/planning-normalization.md` into Governance Kit docs
- add a planning audit checklist
- add `docs/REVIEW-GRAMMAR.md` as the local command grammar for review, normalization, validation, adversarial audit, meta-audit, tracing, and gap closure
- add `validate-review-grammar.ps1` so DCP/Governance Kit can check review grammar adoption in local and adopted repos
- document how Core users adopt Governance Kit incrementally

---

### Phase 3 — Agent Kit Module (future)

**Goal:** Package the AI-agent-specific layer of DCP as a separable module.

The Agent Kit includes:
- task template set
- Model routing pattern library
- Agent onboarding doc template
- Multi-agent handoff protocol

This is DCP's primary market differentiator. Most competing tools solve the registry/dashboard problem. None solve the agent governance problem.

---

### Phase 4 — Distribution (future)

**Goal:** Make DCP findable, installable, and sellable.

- GitHub template repository
- Optional scaffold CLI (`dcp init`)
- Consulting offering (setup + training + custom config)
- Landing page / product positioning

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. **Registry-driven** — `projects.yaml` is the single source of truth. Tools read from it; humans edit it.
2. **Agent-readable** — planning docs follow typed conventions so agents can parse intent without ambiguity.
3. **Boundary-strict** — governance, standards, execution, and runtime are hard-separated layers.
4. **Integrity-enforced** — broken pointers and bulk corpus rewrites are caught at commit time, not discovered later.
5. **Modular** — each component is independently useful. You don't need all of DCP to benefit from any part of it.
6. **No runtime in the repo** — ephemeral agent state does not belong in version control.

## CHANGELOG

- 2026-06-06 — v1.0.0 Studio complete. All modules shipped. GitHub template live.
- 2026-06-06 — v0.2.0 Core Portable extraction completed.
- 2026-06-21 — Governance correction: recent DCP.17/DCP.18 updates inserted rows into existing `DEV-PATH.md` sections while adding append-only policy. Treat that as a one-time normalization exception; future `DEV-PATH.md` updates should append a changelog entry, phase section, PASS entry, or task row without rewriting existing history.
- 2026-07-01 — Added root adapters and docs for GC-AUDIT preflight and CI invariant validation, plus append-only `PLAY.jsonl` telemetry record shape using read/plan/execute/verify/close categories with `started_at`, `ended_at`, and `duration_ms`.
- 2026-07-02 — Marlin Registry validation gate live: commit `98affdb` added the public self-contained manifest/index validation workflow and script, pushed to `origin/main`; GitHub branch protection now requires the `validate` status check in strict mode. The CI deliberately does not check out the private `marlin` source repo, avoiding private-source leakage into public Actions logs.
- 2026-07-02 — Planning-doc identity correction: this repo's inherited DCP-shaped planning docs now have Marlin Registry-specific H1 titles so portfolio planning validation no longer collides with the real DCP/control-plane docs.
- 2026-07-02 — Local topology correction: `C:\dev` was detached from Git because it and `C:\dev\marlin-registry` both pointed to `https://github.com/jj-ervin/marlin-registry.git` at the same HEAD (`3f0c5fd`), making the portfolio root and child project repo indistinguishable to agents and validators. The root `.git` metadata was moved, not deleted, to `C:\dev\_topology-backups\root-dotgit-marlin-registry-20260702-1029`; the empty hidden root `.git` stub left by PowerShell was removed after confirming it had no children. `C:\dev` now correctly fails `git status` as a non-repo workspace root, while `C:\dev\marlin-registry` remains the authoritative `marlin-registry` Git repo.
