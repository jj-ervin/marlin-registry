# DEV-PLAN — Marlin-DXP

**AUTHORITY LEVEL: AL:1**
**Status:** active
**Updated:** 2026-06-28

---

## Purpose

**Marlin-DXP** is the **five-minute governance adoption kit**.

```text
Install governance → Audit the repo → Emit evidence → Show status
```

A developer runs `marlin install`, answers the wizard, and gets a fully conformant
governance scaffold in under 5 minutes. Then it stays: the same tool audits the
repo, normalizes drift, emits signed machine-readable evidence bundles, and reports
portfolio health — for the entire life of the project.

**Honest claim:** Marlin-DXP makes a project audit-ready, evidence-ready, and
control-mapped. It does not make a project compliant. Compliance depends on
operations, controls, legal scope, and sometimes external audit. Marlin-DXP
produces the evidence that an auditor or automated compliance platform can trust.

---

## Current Phase

Phase 1 — Waves 1–4 complete. Wave 5 scope TBD.

**Wave 0 (CLOSED):** Charter, TypeScript scaffold, project registered
**Wave 1 (CLOSED):** Schema pair (gc-principal + gc-conformance + gc-evidence-bundle)
**Wave 2 (CLOSED):** Template library (7 templates), core provisioner, buildBundle()
**Wave 3 (CLOSED):** MVP CLI — `audit validate`, `status`, `install` (Marlin wizard)
**Wave 4 (CLOSED):** Ed25519 signed evidence bundles — signBundle(), verifyBundle(), keystore, `audit verify-bundle`
**Wave 5 (PLANNING):** Scope TBD — candidates: `--reconfigure` brownfield install, compliance presets, remaining audit operations

## Decision Surfaces (full list)

### Principal identity (collected first, before all other questions)

- Name and handle
- Email
- GitHub / GitLab username
- Role: owner / maintainer / installer / auditor
- Entity type: individual / LLC / corporation (+ entity name if org)
- Succession principal (optional)
- Attestation confirmation
- CI/headless mode: service account / bot principal config

### Governance tier

- GC conformance level (advisory / standard / strict)
- Authority level default (AL:1 / AL:2 / AL:3)
- Governance record style (PASS cluster name, or none)
- Business entity type (personal / LLC / corporation)

### Naming (ONS)

- ONS validation tier (FAST / STANDARD / STRICT)
- Namespace and product root
- Separator preference
- VS Code extension naming: `{product}-vscode` vs `vscode-{product}` vs `{product}.vscode`
- Token prefix pattern
- Governance cluster name

### Project shape

- Project type (library / app / CLI / VS Code extension / backend / full-stack / multi-repo)
- Team tier (solo / small team / enterprise)
- Developer experience level (beginner / intermediate / expert — controls wizard verbosity)

### Stack and tooling

- Frontend framework (React / Vue / Svelte / None)
- Backend language (TypeScript / Python / Go / Rust / other)
- CI/CD target (GitHub Actions / GitLab / Azure DevOps / Bitbucket / none)
- Package registry targets (PyPI / npm / both / internal / none)
- License
- Agentic governance (yes → GEE config + ONS agentic domain registration)

### Scaffold options

- Emit DEV-PATH.md and DEV-PLAN.md (yes / no)
- Emit GEE namespace config (yes / no)
- Register in projects.yaml (yes / no)
- Add CI validation workflow (yes / no)
- Append README governance section (yes / no)

## Open Questions

| Question | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| What's the right question order for minimal cognitive load? | Preset-then-customize vs linear wizard vs category grouping |
| Should VS Code extension naming be one choice or per-repo? | An org might have one style; a solo dev might want to choose per project |
| Does Marlin-DXP provision the GEE namespace or just the config? | Namespace registration may require a live service later |
| Electron vs Tauri vs browser-based (local server + open browser)? | Browser-based is zero-install for the GUI shell |
| Should presets be community-extensible? | A GC "official" preset vs org-defined presets vs personal presets |

---

## Non-Goals

- Marlin-DXP does not build or scaffold application code — only governance and developer experience artifacts.
- Marlin-DXP does not require the developer to have eco installed.
- Marlin-DXP does not replace Cockpit — it becomes Cockpit's first-run module when Cockpit ships.
- Marlin-DXP does not define GC standards — it adopts and applies them.
- Marlin-DXP does not own the control lifecycle. Its scope ceiling is Tier 2 (signed
  evidence bundles, CI validation, mapping presets). Continuous control monitoring,
  evidence vaults with retention, exception tracking, risk registers, audit
  workflows, and certification-support integrations (Tiers 3–5) belong to a separate
  runtime product — a Cockpit compliance module that consumes Marlin-DXP's schemas and
  core library. See INIT-D15 in DEV-PATH.md.
- Marlin-DXP never claims a project "is compliant." It produces audit-ready,
  evidence-ready, control-mapped artifacts. Certification comes from external
  auditors, notified bodies, or accredited certifiers.
