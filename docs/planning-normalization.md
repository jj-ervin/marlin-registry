# Planning Normalization Standard

Updated: 2026-06-05

This standard defines how `C:\dev` should unify project direction without forcing every repo into the same internal structure.

## Portfolio Source Of Truth

`projects.yaml` owns cross-project facts:

- `name`
- `path`
- `group`
- `description`
- `status`
- `branch`
- relationship keys such as `runtime_of`, `site_for`, `governance_package`, `depends_on`, `publishes_to`
- `planning` pointers

Child repos own their own implementation details and internal docs.

## Planning Pointer Shape

Use these optional keys under each project:

```yaml
planning:
  canonical: path/to/current-plan.md
  path: path/to/dev-path.md
  tracks: path/to/tracks.md
  roadmap: path/to/roadmap.md
  implementation_plan: path/to/implementation-plan.md
  project: path/to/project.yaml
  changelog: path/to/passchangelog.md
  notes: "Short explanation when direction is inherited, absent, archived, or intentionally deferred."
```

Prefer `canonical` for the current execution plan. Use `path` for history, phase lineage, or longer development path. Use `tracks` when parallel workstreams exist. Use `changelog` only as an audit link.

## Canonical Project Planning Pattern

For mature active projects, prefer this triad:

| File Role | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Current plan | Current execution state, next milestones, active blockers |
| Development path | Historical phases, major decisions, PASS/task lineage |
| Tracks | Parallel workstreams and dependencies |

The file names may vary by repo. The manager registry records the actual paths.

## Minimum Plan For Small Projects

Small or scaffold projects only need one canonical plan containing:

- current status
- next milestone
- active blockers
- done/deferred notes
- links to changelog or audit files, if any

## Status Vocabulary

Portfolio project status:

- `scaffold`: exists but not actively developed
- `wip`: forming, incomplete, or not yet stable
- `active`: current work target
- `stable`: usable standard/product with maintenance work
- `archive`: retained for history

Task/milestone status:

- `planned`
- `in_progress`
- `blocked`
- `done`
- `deferred`
- `unknown_needs_audit`

## Rules

1. Do not create competing root planning docs with new names when a canonical plan already exists.
2. Do not treat snapshots, templates, generated site output, or worktree copies as authoritative planning.
3. Do not use changelogs as the only current-status surface for active projects.
4. If a project inherits direction from a parent track, say so in `projects.yaml`.
5. If a project has duplicate status docs, choose one canonical file and mark the other as alternate or archive.
